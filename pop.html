			<p>Wes Anderson’s typically stylish masterpiece sees the most Fantastic of Foxes outwit a group of duplicitous local farmers. Throughout the film, the central character’s fear of Wolves is alluded to – and in the dying moments of the film the group encounter a Wolf in the distance. “What a beautiful creature”, remarks Mr Fox, prompting his companions to wish the wolf, good luck. The scene was so different to the rest of the film, that it was very nearly not included.</p>
